1. **Cookie Generation and Setting:**
    - When a user visits a site, the server generates a strong pseudorandom value.
    - This value is set as a cookie on the user's machine without the `httpOnly` flag, allowing it to be accessible from JavaScript.
2. **Cookie Value in Form Submission:**
    - Every form submission from the site requires this pseudorandom value to be included as a form value.
    - Simultaneously, the same value should be included as a cookie value in the request.
3. **Validation on Server Side:**
    - Upon receiving a POST request, the server checks whether the form value and the cookie value are identical.
    - If they match, the request is considered valid; otherwise, it's treated as potentially malicious.
4. **Protection Mechanism:**
    - The protection here lies in the fact that an attacker, through a CSRF attack, can forge a form submission but cannot read or modify the cookie value due to the same-origin policy enforced by web browsers.
    - The attacker can include any form value in the request, but since the server compares it with the cookie value, successful submission depends on guessing or stealing the pseudorandom value.
5. **Security Implications:**
    - This technique enhances security by ensuring that form submissions are only accepted if they contain both the form and cookie values, making it challenging for attackers to forge valid requests without access to the pseudorandom value.
