# Definition
Pseudocode is a way of representing an algorithm in a high-level, human-readable form, using a mixture of natural language and basic programming constructs. It is not tied to any specific programming language and serves as a tool for planning and expressing the logic of an algorithm before actual coding.

In pseudocode, you focus on the logical flow of the algorithm rather than the syntax of a particular programming language. It allows you to outline the steps of a solution in a clear and understandable manner, making it easier to transition from the conceptualization of an algorithm to its implementation.

Pseudocode often uses keywords like `if,` `else,` `while,` and `for` to describe control structures, and it employs indentation to represent code blocks. Variable names and operations are written in **plain** English to enhance readability.

Using pseudocode can be beneficial when collaborating with others, discussing algorithmic concepts, or planning the structure of a program without getting bogged down in language-specific details.

# Steps
1. **Understand the Problem:**
    - Before diving into pseudocode, thoroughly understand the problem you're solving.
    - Identify the inputs, outputs, and the steps needed to transform inputs into outputs.
2. **Break Down the Problem:**    
    - Divide the problem into smaller, manageable tasks.
    - Create a high-level plan of the major steps your algorithm needs to take.
3. **Use Simple Language:**
    - Pseudocode is a mix of natural language and programming constructs.
    - Use plain English to describe each step.
    - Use control structures like loops and conditionals when necessary.
4. **Follow Standard Conventions:**
    - There are no strict rules for pseudocode, but consistency is key.
    - Use indentation to represent code blocks.
    - Follow a logical flow from top to bottom.
5. **Be Clear and Concise:**
    - Write pseudocode in a way that's easy to understand.
    - Use clear variable names and avoid unnecessary details.
6. **Use Control Structures:**
    - Include decision-making (if statements) and iteration (loops) when needed.
    - Represent conditions and loops in a way that's clear and concise.
7. **Test Your Pseudocode:**
    - Mentally walk through your pseudocode with sample inputs.
    - Ensure that each step logically leads to the next.
8. **Seek Feedback:**
    - Share your pseudocode with peers or mentors.
    - Get feedback on its clarity and effectiveness

# Example = Binary Search

## Plain English
Given an **sorted** array of numbers, with no duplicates, and a value to find, called `target`...
1. Set a variable `lo` as the start of the array, and `high` as the end of the array.
2. Using `lo` and `high`, find the midpoint of the array. 
3. If the value at the midpoint is equal to the target, return the index.
4. If the value at the midpoint is greater than the target, cut out the right side of the array. The value must be to the left.
5. If the value at the midpoint is less than the target, cut out the left side of the array. The value must be to the right.
6. Repeat until the value is found.

## Pseudocode
```
# Binary Search Algorithm
arr is the array. 
target is the variable to search for.

set lo = 0
set high = arr.length
set mid = (lo + high) / 2

while lo < high (when they are the same, there is only one value left)
	if midValue = target
		return mid
	else if midValue > target
		hi = mid # Cut out the right side of the array
	else 
		lo = mid + 1 # Cut out the left side of the array

if target is not found, return -1
```
