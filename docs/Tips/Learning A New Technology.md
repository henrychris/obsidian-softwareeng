# Understand The Technology
1. Why was it created?
2. What problem does it solve?
3. How is it used in real-life scenarios today?
4. When is the right time to use it?
5. What are the alternatives to using it?

# Follow Along
Here, you watch a master at work. You follow a tutorial or read a book or take a course. You copy it line by line, and maybe experiment a little. 
The aim is to understand the patterns and the reasoning for the choices.

# Practice
Recreate the tasks from the learning resource. You can reference the resource to refresh your memory, but do not copy. When stuck, return and refresh, then try again. 
Practice over, and over again (maybe thrice), until it sticks.

# Mastery
Build 15 projects, all medium-scale. If you find yourself getting stuck, return to practising.

# Second-Nature Mastery
Teach someone else. Teach a lot of people. Let the technology be ingrained in your subconscious.
