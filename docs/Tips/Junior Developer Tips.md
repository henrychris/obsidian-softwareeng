### Career Tips
1. Join a community, share, and give back.
2. Position yourself and promote yourself. Write about your projects.
3. Try to get a **call** with the hirers or technical people at the company. Try to get to the interview phase where they can see you as a person and **promote** yourself. A **FIVE** minute call is all it takes sometimes.
4. Don't take rejections personally. Set an email filter to catch rejections so they don't fuck you up.
5. Set a time to search and apply for roles. Set a time to learn. Set a time to work.
6. Contribute to OSS.
7. Build your portfolio.
8. Focus on IMPACT. Always think about the **why** to your work and focus your energy on work that aligns with your interests AND that of the company. That is the fastest way to grow your career. Discuss project prioritization with your manager and team lead.
9. Learn to sell. The succinct and clear reasoning of top developers makes it easy for them to convince or influence people. Read: [How To Win Friends And Influence People] by Dale Carnegie.
	_"The only way on earth to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show them how to get it"_
10. Own your projects. It doesn't matter who does the work, as long as it is done right. This is why in startups, you see people wear many hats at the early stage.
