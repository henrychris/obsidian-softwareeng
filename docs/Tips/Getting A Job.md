# Job Search Strategy
- Split time between **Learning/Building** and **Networking**
- Never stop learning.

# Standing Out From The Noise

# Portfolio Projects
- You need to have one GREAT project.
- It needs to be something built by you. Not a tutorial. Not a clone. Not a common project. It should be **UNIQUE** and **ATTENTION-GRABBING**.
- It needs to be **interesting** and prompt interviewers to ask more questions.
	- e.g. a python script that converts drum beats to a music script
- It should have interesting technical problems to solve.
- Look to personal problems for inspiration.
