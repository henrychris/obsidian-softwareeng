Here's a suggested slide structure for your presentation, along with presenter notes for each slide.

---

### Slide 1: Event-Driven Systems
**Title:** Event Driven Systems  
**Content:**
- Uses events for communication between system components.
- Publisher and consumer are decoupled through a message broker.

**Presenter Notes:**
- Emphasize the decoupling benefit, explaining that publishers and consumers are unaware of each other's details.
- Define what events are: a record of something that happened, not instructions.

---

### Slide 2: Actors in an Event-Driven System  
**Title:** Primary Actors  
**Content:**
- **Producer (Emitter):** Publishes events.
- **Consumer:** Listens and reacts to events.
- **Router (Message Broker):** Handles event distribution to consumers.

**Presenter Notes:**
- Mention that the router isn't a manual component but is abstracted by tools like message brokers (NATS).
- For JS developers: there's no need for manual routing.

---

### Slide 3: Event-Driven Concepts  
**Title:** Concepts  
**Content:**
- **Idempotency**: Handle duplicate events safely.
- **Decoupling**: Services communicate through message contracts only.
- **Eventual Consistency**: Data sync happens over time.

**Presenter Notes:**
- Make sure to stress the importance of idempotency.
- Show the link about coupling vs. decoupling and recommend reading it for more in-depth understanding.

---

### Slide 4: Event-Driven Components  
**Title:** Components  
**Content:**
- **Event Bus:** Routes events between producers and consumers.
- **Event Store (Optional):** Stores event history. JetStream can store events.
- Events related to data should be published by a single service.

**Presenter Notes:**
- Explain JetStream in more depth later, during the NATS section.

---

### Slide 5: Event-Driven Benefits  
**Title:** Benefits  
**Content:**
- Auto-recovery after crashes.
- Services and data are independent.

**Presenter Notes:**
- Touch briefly on "distributed monoliths"—why they’re bad and how event-driven systems avoid them.
  
---

### Slide 6: Event-Driven Problems  
**Title:** Problems  
**Content:**
- Complexity of the architecture.
- Issues with in-order processing, exactly-once delivery, and failure recovery.

**Presenter Notes:**
- Bring up the scenario: What happens if a server crashes right after saving data to the DB but before publishing an event?

---

### Slide 7: Designing & Documenting Events  
**Title:** Designing & Documenting Events  
**Content:**
- Reference links:
    - Designing events: [serverlessland](https://serverlessland.com/event-driven-architecture/designing-events).
    - Putting events on a diet: [particular.net](https://particular.net/blog/putting-your-events-on-a-diet).

**Presenter Notes:**
- Event design is crucial for scaling, keep payloads light.
- Mention the importance of documentation—show examples like Event Catalog.

---

### Slide 8: Introduction to NATS  
**Title:** NATS Overview  
**Content:**
- A messaging system that enables publish-subscribe communication.
- Simple, fast, and used for building event-driven systems.

**Presenter Notes:**
- NATS is lightweight and focused on low latency.
- Use examples to show its simplicity compared to other brokers.

---

### Slide 9: Core NATS: Publish-Subscribe  
**Title:** Core NATS  
**Content:**
- Producers send messages to **subjects**.
- Consumers subscribe to subjects to receive messages.

**Presenter Notes:**
- Demo how to publish/subscribe using Core NATS (Demo 1).
- Explain how messages are lost if the consumer isn’t connected.

---

### Slide 10: Subjects & Wildcards  
**Title:** Subjects & Wildcards  
**Content:**
- **Subjects** act as message addresses.
- **Wildcards**:
    - `*` matches a single token.
    - `>` matches multiple tokens.

**Presenter Notes:**
- Demo how wildcards can be used for hierarchical messaging (Demo 1).
- Highlight their usefulness in complex systems.

---

### Slide 11: Queue Groups for Load Balancing  
**Title:** Queue Groups  
**Content:**
- Messages are distributed to one consumer in a queue group.
- Ideal for **load balancing**.

**Presenter Notes:**
- Demo how queue groups work and why they help scale horizontally (Demo 4).

---

### Slide 12: JetStream Overview  
**Title:** JetStream  
**Content:**
- Built-in persistence engine for message storage and replay.
- Ensures messages aren’t lost if consumers go offline.

**Presenter Notes:**
- Demo the difference between Core NATS and JetStream in handling message loss (Demo 2).
- Focus on persistence benefits.

---

### Slide 13: Streams in JetStream  
**Title:** Streams, Limits & Retention Policies  
**Content:**
- **Streams** store messages under specific subjects.
- **Limits**: control on message storage based on time, size, or count.
- **Retention Policies**: Limits-based, Interest-based, Work Queue.

**Presenter Notes:**
- Demo stream creation and message retention (Demo 2).
- Explain the difference between retention policies.

---

### Slide 14: Consumers in JetStream  
**Title:** Consumers  
**Content:**
- **Durable Consumers**: Keep track of progress, can resume from where they left off.
- **Ephemeral Consumers**: Only active while connected.

**Presenter Notes:**
- Show off how durable consumers remember their position, while ephemeral ones don’t (Demo 3).
  
---

### Slide 15: JetStream Delivery Semantics  
**Title:** JetStream Delivery Semantics  
**Content:**
- By default, **at-least-once** delivery. 
- Supports **exactly-once** delivery using message deduplication and double acknowledgments.

**Presenter Notes:**
- Demo the at-least-once and deduplication features (Demo 3).

---

### Slide 16: Basic Service Demo  
**Title:** Demo: Basic Service  
**Content:**
- Show a basic **publish-subscribe** event flow between services.

**Presenter Notes:**
- Start simple with a publish/subscribe flow and gradually build on top of it.

---

### Slide 17: Service Outage Demo  
**Title:** Demo: Service Outage  
**Content:**
- Simulate **message loss** with Core NATS when the consumer goes down.
- Show how JetStream ensures persistence during outages.

**Presenter Notes:**
- Run the outage simulation (Demo 2).
- Emphasize the importance of persistence.

---

### Slide 18: Idempotency Demo  
**Title:** Demo: Idempotency  
**Content:**
- Explain **idempotency** and demonstrate why consumers should be idempotent.

**Presenter Notes:**
- Show what happens when a non-idempotent consumer is used (Demo 3).

---

### Slide 19: Load Balancing Demo  
**Title:** Demo: Load Balancing  
**Content:**
- Demonstrate **queue groups** and how they balance load across consumers.

**Presenter Notes:**
- Demo load balancing by scaling horizontally with queue groups (Demo 4).

---

### Slide 20: Event-Driven System Demo  
**Title:** Demo: Full Event-Driven System  
**Content:**
- Tie all concepts together into a full event-driven system demo.

**Presenter Notes:**
- Show how the components come together, discussing idempotency, load balancing, and persistence.
