# Algorithms 101
An algorithm is a set of instructions to be followed to achieve a certain goal. *Algorithm design* aims to create an **efficient** set of instructions, that can be **effectively** used to solve a real-world problem.

## Phases of an algorithm

```
Problem Statement -> Algorithm -> Computing Device

Input -> Computing Device -> Output
```
There are two phases:
1. **Design:** An iterative phase where the architecture and logic of the algorithm are considered. In this stage, different possible solutions are conceptualised and compared against one another. The final algorithm should be an efficient solution that provides both satisfactory performance and reasonable accuracy at the same time.
2. **Coding:** The designed algorithm is converted into a computer program.

Both phases are iterative.
