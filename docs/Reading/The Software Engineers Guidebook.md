# Owning Your Career
## You're in charge. 
1. Set **goals**. 
2. Tell your manager what work you wish to do and care about. 
3. Choose work that creates **impact**. 
4. Share work you do that goes unnoticed. 
5. Create opportunities to receive **feedback**.

## Be Someone Who Gets Things Done
1. Get **impactful** stuff done. Ship high-quality code at a decent pace and over-deliver when necessary. Understand the team's priorities so you know what to do.
2. Make sure people **know** you are getting stuff done!
3. Keep a work log. **VERY** important. Check [[Brag Document Template]]

## Ask And Give Feedback
- Code reviews
- Share proposals, design documents and ideas and ask for feedback
- Utilise peer performance reviews
- Rather than ask for personal feedback, ask for feedback on work you did, or projects you worked on, or meetings you led. 

## Give Feedback
- Call out good work
- Be specific with your feedback
- Only give positive feedback when you **mean** it
- Give negative or constructive feedback in person
- Make clear that it is only an observation
- Focus on the situation and its impact. "This happened and led to this, because x, y, z."
- Decode poor quality feedback
	- Ask for specific examples
	- Clarify what impact your action had
	- Ask for suggestions
	- If you disagree, explain why you disagree

## Make Your Manager An Ally
- Have regular 1-1 time with them. Discuss challenges, recent work and wins. Ask how you can help them and the team.
- Tell, don't assume they know.
- Understand your manager's goals. This can help you understand what work has an impact.
- Deliver what you agree upon, and give updates when you can't meet up. However, try to be reliable.
- Establish mutual trust.

## Pace Yourself
Stretching. Executing. Coasting.
