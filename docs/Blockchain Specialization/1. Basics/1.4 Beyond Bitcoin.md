Ethereum extended Bitcoin scripting into a full code execution framework - Smart Contracts. This allows executing of business logic on blockchains.
# Blockchain Types
- **Cryptocurrency Only**  
    This type of blockchain is designed solely for facilitating the creation, transfer, and management of digital currencies (cryptocurrencies). It focuses on enabling secure peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries (like banks). These blockchains have a very specific purpose: maintaining a ledger of who owns what cryptocurrency and preventing issues like double-spending.
    - **Example**: Bitcoin is a classic example of a cryptocurrency-only blockchain. It has minimal functionality beyond its role as a decentralised ledger for tracking Bitcoin transactions.
- **Cryptocurrency + Business Logic**  
    These blockchains support not only cryptocurrency transactions but also the execution of programmable smart contracts and decentralised applications (dApps). They allow for more complex interactions, automating agreements and workflows with embedded business logic. This adds a layer of flexibility to execute conditions or rules within the blockchain ecosystem.
    - **Example**: Ethereum is a notable example. In addition to its cryptocurrency (Ether), it supports smart contracts that enable developers to write and deploy complex decentralised applications (such as DeFi platforms, NFT marketplaces, etc.).
- **Business Logic Only**  
    This type of blockchain is focused purely on executing business logic and smart contracts, often without a native cryptocurrency. These blockchains may not have their own digital currency but focus on secure, decentralised processing of business transactions, workflows, and data management. Such blockchains are often used in enterprise contexts where businesses need to automate processes or share data securely across multiple parties.
    - **Example**: Hyperledger Fabric is an example of a blockchain that focuses on business use cases. It allows companies to build private, permissioned blockchains tailored to their specific needs, with no emphasis on cryptocurrency.
# Blockchain Categories 
- **Public Blockchain**: Accessible to anyone willing to participate. Examples include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. These are fully decentralised and transparent.
- **Private Blockchain**: Access is restricted to authorised participants, typically within an organisation. This makes it more centralised with higher privacy controls.
- **Consortium Blockchain**: Managed by a pre-selected set of nodes, such as a group of organisations. The network is partially decentralised, but access and control are limited to the consortium members
# Use Cases
1.  Real Estate - track who owns a piece of property and allow exchange of property.
2. Supply chain management - store items in the supply chain on the blockchain. Track their movement and status.
3. Digital Ids - i imagine a country storing its people on the blockchain. See [here](https://consensys.io/blockchain-use-cases/digital-identity#for-individuals).
4. Wills & Inheritance - store a will on the blockchain to track and prevent changes. Use smart contracts to execute the inheritance and distribute assets. This seems very future-esque. Will probably be a while yet till it has a thorough implementation.
5. Digital voting - Make voting transparent and track any changes to the voter registry or vote counts.
