# Participants
There are two main participants in the Bitcoin blockchain:
1. **Transaction Initiators** - These are users or systems that create transactions involving the transfer of value between participants.
2. **Mining Nodes aka Miners** - They use computing power to: 
	- Verify transactions.
    - Create blocks by gathering transactions from the mempool.
    - **Race to complete a block** by solving the puzzle (Proof of Work)
    - **Reach consensus** by broadcasting the block to other nodes for validation.
    - **Broadcast new blocks** and confirm transactions in those blocks.
# Operations
# 1. Gathering Transactions
- **Transaction Creation**: Transactions are created by wallets, which digitally sign them using the sender's private key.
- **Broadcasting**: The wallet broadcasts the signed transaction to the connected nodes in the network.
- **Initial Validation**: Nodes receive the transaction and perform initial validation checks to ensure its structure, digital signature, and inputs are valid.
# 2. Broadcasting Valid Transactions
- **Propagation**: Once validated, nodes broadcast the valid transaction to their connected peers. Each node receiving the transaction repeats this process, propagating it across the network.
- **Mempool**: Valid transactions are added to each node’s local **mempool** (a memory pool of valid, unconfirmed transactions).
# 3. Consensus on Next Block Creation
- **Transaction Selection**: Miners select transactions from their **mempool**, prioritising those with higher transaction fees. These transactions are added to a candidate block.
- **Proof of Work (PoW)**: Miners then race to solve the **PoW puzzle** (as outlined in [[1.2 Blockchain Structure#Proof Of Work]]). Solving the puzzle gives the miner the right to add the next block and claim the block reward (coinbase reward).
- **Block Validation**: Once a miner solves the PoW, they broadcast the block to their connected nodes for validation. These nodes check the block's validity according to the blockchain's rules.    
- **Consensus**: Consensus is achieved when the majority of nodes in the network agree that the block is valid based on the blockchain’s consensus rules (e.g., PoW validation, transaction checks).    
- **Block Propagation**: As each node validates the block, they add it to their local copy of the blockchain and broadcast it to their connected peers. This process continues until the block is fully propagated across the network.
- If the block is valid, nodes check if any transactions in their mempool are in a block. If so, the transaction is removed from the mempool as it is now confirmed.
# 4. Chaining Blocks
- **Block Hash**: Each block contains the **hash of the previous block**, forming a continuous chain of blocks.
- **Immutable Chain**: This structure ensures the security of the blockchain’s history. If any block is altered, the hash of that block changes, which breaks the linkage of all subsequent blocks. Recomputing the hash for all affected blocks is computationally infeasible due to the consensus mechanisms (such as Proof of Work).
- **New Block Addition**: When nodes receive a new valid block, they add it to their local copy of the blockchain by linking it to the previous block using its hash.
