A block contains some data, a hash & the hash of the previous block. Any sort of data may be stored in a block.
A hash is similar to a fingerprint. It identifies the block and is unique. If data is changed in the block, the hash changes.
The hash of the previous block is used to chain blocks together.

The first block is known as the genesis block. Tampering with a single block in a chain (and rendering its hash invalid) renders all subsequent blocks invalid. 

Blockchains use a proof of work to slow the creation of new blocks. Before a new block is created, the proof of work must be computed. Tampering with one block  requires you to recalculate its hash & proof of work and recalculate the same for all subsequent blocks in the chain.

In Bitcoin, (explain how PoW is computed)

As the blockchain is distributed and decentralised, anyone can join the network (by creating a node). New nodes get a full copy of the blockchain, which they can use to verify that everything is in order. 
When a new block is issued, it is published to the network. Nodes verify this block to ensure it is valid, then they add it to their chain. All nodes reach a consensus, agreeing on which blocks are valid or invalid.

Tampering with a blockchain would require tampering with all blocks in a chain, redoing the proof of work and hashes for each, and controlling the majority of nodes in the network. This is just to get a single tampered block accepted by the network.
