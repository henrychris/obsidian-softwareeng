# Course Objectives
- State the *three* fundamental characteristics that define a blockchain
- State important features of the Ethereum blockchain
- Explain the algorithms & techniques that enable a blockchain
- Outline methods for realising **trust** in a blockchain.
# Blockchain Defined
A blockchain is a decentralised system that enables **peer-to-peer** transfers of digital assets without intermediaries. It establishes _trust_ between unknown peers and records transactions in an **immutable** distributed ledger.
# Bitcoin
Bitcoin, created by _Satoshi Nakamoto_, contributed two major innovations:
1. A continuously functioning **digital currency system**
2. A model for autonomous decentralized applications

Bitcoin enabled peer-to-peer (P2P) value transfers without a central authority. It established trust by using programs for validation, verification, and **consensus** on the blockchain.
- **What is consensus here?**
	Consensus in blockchain refers to the agreement among participants on the validity of a transaction or the state of the blockchain. Various consensus algorithms, like Proof of Work (PoW), ensure that all participants agree on the current version of the distributed ledger. This prevents double-spending and ensures that everyone has a consistent view of the blockchain.

# Trust In Decentralised Systems
_Trust_ in blockchain refers to the system's ability to function securely and transparently without the need for intermediaries (e.g., banks or governments). It is achieved through mechanisms like validation, verification, consensus, and immutability, which ensure that all participants in the network can rely on the data being accurate and tamper-proof.

In decentralised systems, peers interact directly without a central authority. Trust is established through the following mechanisms:
1. **Validation**: Ensures that the transactions are legitimate.
2. **Verification**: Confirms the correctness of the transactions.
3. **Consensus**: Agreement on the valid block to be added to the chain by network participants.
4. **Immutable Recording**: Once a block is added, the transaction history is permanent and tamper-proof.
