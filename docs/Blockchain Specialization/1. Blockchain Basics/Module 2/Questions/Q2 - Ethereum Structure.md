# About Ethereum  
1. What consensus mechanism does Ethereum use?  
2. How does the block time in Ethereum compare to other blockchains like Bitcoin?  
3. Why does Ethereum’s block size remain relatively small?  
4. What is the annual limit on ETH issuance, and how does it help control inflation?
# Accounts  
5. What are the two types of accounts in Ethereum, and how do they differ?  
6. What is the purpose of the **nonce** field in an Ethereum account?  
7. Where is the smart contract code stored, and how is it referenced within the account?  
8. What is the **Storage Root Hash**, and how does it represent the current state of an account’s storage?  
9. How does the global state tree ensure that all account balances and data remain consistent on the blockchain?
# Transactions  
10. What are the three main types of Ethereum transactions?  
11. Why does every transaction include a **nonce** field?  
12. What role does the `maxPriorityFeePerGas` play in transaction processing?  
13. How does a validator handle a transaction from initiation to finalisation?  
14. What happens to gas fees if a transaction fails?
# Gas  
15. What is the purpose of gas in Ethereum, and why is it necessary?  
16. How does Ethereum calculate **gas fees**, and what happens to the base fee after a transaction?  
17. How does the **priority fee** affect the likelihood of a transaction being included in the next block?  
18. What is the difference between **gas cost** and **gas price**?  
19. How do view and pure functions in smart contracts avoid gas costs?  
# Proof of Stake (PoS)  
20. How does Ethereum’s PoS mechanism incentivise validators to behave honestly?  
21. What happens if a validator stays offline or fails to perform their duties?  
22. What is a **slot**, and how does it relate to a validator's role in block proposals?  
23. How many slots make up an epoch, and how long does an epoch last?  
24. What does it mean for a validator to “attest” to a block, and why is attestation important?
# Fork Choice and finalisation
25. What is the **LMD-GHOST** algorithm, and how does it resolve forks in Ethereum?  
26. How does Ethereum determine which chain to consider valid during conflicting histories?  
27. What conditions must be met for a block to be **finalised**?  
28. How long does it take for a block to become finalised on Ethereum?
# Blocks in Ethereum  
29. What is the function of the **block header** in Ethereum?  
30. What information is included in a block’s **parent hash**, and why is it important?  
31. What does the **state root** represent in a block, and how is it calculated?  
32. How are transactions organised within an Ethereum block?  
33. What is the purpose of the **validator signature** in the context of PoS?
