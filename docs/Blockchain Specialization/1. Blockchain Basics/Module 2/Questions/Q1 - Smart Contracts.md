# Smart Contracts
## Conceptual Understanding
1. What is a smart contract, and how does it differ from traditional contracts?
2. How do smart contracts interact with a blockchain network?
3. Why are smart contracts considered “deterministic”? What does that mean in practice?
4. What is the role of user accounts and transactions in interacting with smart contracts?
5. In what ways are smart contracts "composable," and what implications does that have for developers?
## History and Evolution
6. Who coined the term "smart contract," and what was the original intention behind it?
7. What was the significance of Ethereum’s introduction of programmable smart contracts in 2013?
8. How has the concept of smart contracts evolved since their introduction?
## Real-World Applications and Examples
9. Provide an example of how a smart contract might be used in a supply chain agreement.
10. How can smart contracts help ensure trust between two or more parties?
11. What is a **Multisig contract**, and how does it improve security?
## Enforceability and Security
12. What are the main benefits of using smart contracts?
13. What are the main risks associated with smart contracts?
14. How does immutability improve enforceability, and what drawbacks does it introduce?
15. What does it mean for a contract to be “upgradeable,” and how do proxies enable this?
## Technical Aspects
16. Why are audits considered crucial in smart contract development?
17. What is Solidity, and how is it used in Ethereum smart contracts?
18. How are Ethereum smart contracts executed by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)?
## Limitations and Future Directions
19. Why is isolation a limitation for smart contracts, and how do hybrid smart contracts attempt to solve it?
20. What role does **Chainlink** play in enabling hybrid smart contracts?
21. How does immutability restrict bug fixing and feature updates in smart contracts?
## Blockchain and Smart Contracts Architecture
22. What does it mean that smart contracts are “publicly recorded” on Ethereum? How does this benefit audits?
23. Explain how smart contracts achieve **predictable outcomes** compared to traditional legal systems.
24. What does “no central point of failure” imply for smart contract security?
## Layer Two Technologies and Scaling
25. What are **Layer Two technologies**?
26. How can Layer Two solutions complement smart contracts and improve blockchain performance?
