A smart contract is a computer program stored on a blockchain network. They execute when triggered by a predefined condition described in the code.
Smart contracts allow developers to build business logic into the blockchain network. Applications are created using code in smart contracts, which are stored and executed by the underlying blockchain network.

On Ethereum, smart contracts are a type of account. They have a balance and can be the target of transactions. They're not controlled by a user, instead they are deployed to the network and run as programmed. User accounts can then interact with a smart contract by submitting transactions that execute a function defined on the smart contract. Smart contracts can define rules, like a regular contract, and automatically enforce them via the code. Smart contracts cannot be deleted by default, and interactions with them are irreversible.

Smart contracts are composable. You may call another smart contract from within a smart contract. Hell, they can even deploy other smart contracts.

There are also `Multisig` (multiple-signature) contracts are smart contracts that require multiple valid signatures from different addresses (representing different parties) to execute a transaction.
# History
The term originated in 1994, coined by [Nick Szabo](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/smart.contracts.html). He wished to store contracts in a digital ledger.

In 2013, Ethereum launched, supporting programmable smart contracts on the blockchain. 
They also released Solidity, a language for building smart contracts, which is compiled into byte-code and executed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine.
This revolutionised blockchains, they were no longer a simple medium for peer to peer value transfers, but capable of automating business processes & trust-based agreements. 
# Examples
A simple smart contract may have two conditions:
1. If goods arrive on time, send X ETH to the supplier
2. If goods arrive one day late, send 90% of X ETH to the supplier.
# How They Work
- An contract is defined and represented in code. The smart contract is deployed to the blockchain.
- An event triggers execution.
- The contract policy is automatically executed and assets are distributed as defined.
- The transaction is settled and all details are recorded on the blockchain.
# Enforceability
Smart contracts are executed exactly as programmed. They are deterministic such that the same input will always lead to the same output. 
They are also immutable, so the creator of the contract may not change the terms in secret.

The main risk is *smart contract risk*, that is, a flaw in the code that cause an undesirable outcome.

However, with the right design, its possible to eliminate the risk that the other party in a contract does not fulfil their obligations.

For maximum enforceability, smart contracts might be combined with real world systems like credit scores, proof of funds and legal contracts (records may even be stored on the blockchain too).
# Benefits
- **Security** - No central point of failure, no intermediaries that may be bribed, no way to tamper with the contract or outcome.
- **Reliability** - The contract logic will be processed & verified by the blockchain nodes with high correctness guarantees
- **Efficiency** - No middlemen, no manual data entry, all processes are automated making the process faster & cheaper.
- **Automatic Execution** - once certain conditions are met, the contract deterministically executes code without waiting for an intermediary to approve.
- **Predictable Outcomes** - unlike judges that may understand terms of a contract in different ways and thus enforce differently, smart contract execute **exactly** what is defined in code.
- **Publicly Recorded** - Smart contracts are useful for audits and tracking. Since Ethereum smart contracts are on a public blockchain, anyone can instantly track asset transfers and other related information.
# Limitations
## Immutability
While immutability is an advantage, it is also a weakness for smart contracts. Contracts may not be changed to fix bugs, add features or expand the scope. As such, audits are an **extremely** important part of the development process.

However, developers may create upgradeable smart contracts, where a proxy contract points to a new upgraded contract.
## Isolation
Blockchains have no built in connection to the outside world & its systems. Therefore they can't verify real world events or access the Internet. There's currently work being done on **hybrid** smart contracts that use Chainlink to combine on-chain code with off-chain systems.
# Why trust a smart contract?
- They are immutable. Once a smart contract is published, it can not be removed.
- They are distributed - the output is validated by every node on the network. 
# What are Layer Two technologies?
Layer One refers to the blockchain itself. Layer-2 refers to a network, framework or technology that operates on top of an underlying blockchain to improve its scalability and efficiency.

When scaling the blockchain, Layer-One solutions seek to improve performance by changing the rules of the blockchain. 
One example is using a PoS consensus protocol over PoW.

Layer 2 technologies are scaling solutions that operate on top of a Layer 1 blockchain (like Ethereum) to improve its performance. Their primary goal is to reduce transaction costs and increase speed without compromising the security and decentralisation of the underlying Layer 1 network.

There are various types of Layer 2 technologies:
- Side chains - Independent blockchains, with their own consensus protocol, that run in parallel to the main blockchain. They  are linked to Layer 1 for asset transfers.
- State channels - Transactions occur off-chain and the result is posted to the blockchain.
- Rollups - batch transactions off-chain and post a summary to layer 1
- Plasma - A framework for building scalable child chains anchored to the main blockchain. Plasma chains can handle many transactions and periodically report results to the main chain.
# Another Angle
The blockchain is always-on computing power. You could in theory, write all your code and deploy to the blockchain, creating a decentralised product that is always available - without needing to manage servers.
# Evolution
Smart contracts have since evolved.

- **DeFi (Decentralised Finance)** - Smart contracts now underpin decentralised financial services like lending, borrowing, trading, and yield farming.
- **NFT Boom**: Ethereum smart contracts enabled the minting and trading of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), revolutionizing the digital art and gaming sectors.
- **DAOs**: Smart contracts now facilitate decentralised governance, where token holders vote on project decisions via blockchain-based protocols.
- **Interoperability**: Cross-chain bridges and **Layer 2** solutions allow smart contracts to interact across multiple blockchains, improving scalability and reducing fees.
- **Hybrid smart contracts**: With the introduction of **oracles** like Chainlink, smart contracts can now integrate off-chain data, enabling real-world applications like weather-based insurance.
- **Upgradeable contracts**: Developers introduced **proxy patterns** to work around immutability, allowing smart contracts to be upgraded without redeployment.
- **Auditing and security improvements**: With increased use, audits and formal verification have become critical to reduce **smart contract risks** and prevent exploits.

Smart contracts have set in place building blocks for the creation of a **decentralised economy**. How it ends up remains to be seen.
