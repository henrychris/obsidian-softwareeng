An ETH node is a computational unit representing a user. A **full node** hosts the software required for the following tasks:
- **Transaction initiation** and **validation**
- **Mining** (obsolete, replaced by PoS)
- **Block creation**
- **Smart contract execution**
- Operation of the **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)**, which processes smart contracts and updates the blockchain state.

Smart contracts are designed, developed and deployed on the EVM. When the target address in a transaction is a smart contract, the code corresponding to the contract is loaded and executed. 
All validators in the network execute the smart contract, but only the **block proposer** includes the contract’s state update in the new block. The input is fetched from the **data** field of the *transaction*.
Once executed, the contract’s **internal state** may change, and the new state is **propagated** across the network to update the global state.

Transaction validation involves checking timestamp, nonce combination to be valid & checking for sufficient fees. Validators gather valid transactions, **execute them**, and include them in a **new block**.
