**PX vs EM**
There is no better or worse option, each has its own use, **em** and **rem** are generally very good with text sizing because they adapt to the screen in relation to parent or the browser's default text sizing. Using **em** for texts is helpful with accessibility too because the browser's default text size can be changed for people with sight issues. Pixels on the other hand, are generally really good for establishing explicit, robust and precise spacing between elements on the screen. In both cases, the use of css variables for spacing can make media queries easier because you can just change the variable, instead of changing every container or text with a specific spacing. I personally don't see any issue with the pixel spacing in your solution. Keep in mind, media queries have a purpose, there's no reason not to use them!

**IMAGE PROPERTIES**
There's one slight mistake in your solution regarding how the image adapts to smaller screens. If you look closely at the figma design, the image doesn't seem to get smaller as the screen size shrinks; instead, the image remains the same size, but as the container shrinks, you can see a smaller fraction of the image. This is done with a css property called `object-fit`. I suggest experimenting with it, [here's a source that you might find helpful](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_object-fit.asp).
