- Soft skills matter now more than ever.
- As a dev, the true test of knowledge is being able to explain a concept to your parents. Or a five year old. Or a business exec who has never touched a computer.
- **Adapatability:** Thriving among changing circumstances and personalities
- **Collaboration:** Working effectively across disciplines and personalities
- Skill isn't all that matters, relationships do too. Often more than skill.
- **Emotional Intelligence:** Reading the room and managing interactions
- How to move from being an *individual contributor* to *growing as a group*. Use community to power your growth.
## Classwork
1. When last did you receive feedback on your communication style? What surprised you? What do you think you need to improve?
	- My co-founder mentioned that I often switch between different contexts which often seems random. The context switch is often followed by a vague reference to something else that causes listeners to get confused.
	- I need to improve how I carry people along while communicating. I oculd explicitly say, "oh unrelated to that, this made me think of X".
2. What soft skill do you rely on most in day-to-day work? Which do you use least?
	- I write a lot. I have to write about what I am working on, what I am having problems with, and what I am trying to implement.
	- I am not sure what I use the least.
3. What would your coworkers say is your greatest interpersonal strength?
	- My dependability. If I say I do something, I will.
4. What's one soft skill gap that has directly impacted a technical outcome in your work?
	- Inability to man-manage. In my role at Lights on Heights, my inability to extend grace/patience to coworkers not as good as me caused resentment, causing speed of implementation to slow.
	- It's a lack of empathy and patience.
5. How do you currently track your growth in non-technical areas?
	- I don't.
## Other

2. the human ability to communicate, connect and collaborate is invaluable in the age of ai

Alerts ensure timely resolution of system anomalies and minimise downtime. They can be:
- Threshold-based: when metrics exceed predefined thresholds
- Anomaly-based: when metrics exhibit unusual patterns or behaviour, e.g excessive memory use or incoming requests
