# Components
They are reusable UI elements that combine HTML, CSS and JS. For example, this could be a table of contents in HTML:

```
<ol>  

<li>Components: UI Building Blocks</li>  

<li>Defining a Component</li>  

<li>Using a Component</li>  

</ol>
```

But in React, you could represent this as a `<TableOfContents>` component.

## Defining a Component
There are **four** things that are required:
1. The export statement: `export default` (default exports) or `export` (named exports)
2. The function definition: `function Foo()`
3. The markup: this is the combination of HTML, CSS and JS. For example: `return <div> </div>`.
4. They must start with **capital** letters when defined and called.

```
export function ProfileImage() {
  return (
    <img src='https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg' alt='Some lady'></img>
  )
}

Usage: <ProfileImage/>
```
