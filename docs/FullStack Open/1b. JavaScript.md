# const, var or let?

## var
The `var` keyword declares a function scoped variable, not a block-scoped variable. In the snippet below, it will print 0-9, 'outside' and 10. The value `i` is still defined outside the scope of the `for` loop, and withing the function `stuff`.

```
function stuff() {
    for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        console.log(i)
    }

    console.log("outside");
    console.log(i)
}

stuff();
console.log(i);
```

However, the `console.log(i)` statement after the call to `stuff()` will throw an error as `i` is undefined in that context.
But, if a value is defined with `var` outside of a function, it has global scope.
## let
This defines a block-scoped variable. It will print 0-9 in the `for` loop, and throw an error outside as `i` is undefined.
```
for(let i = 0; i<10; i++) {  
console.log(i)  
}  
console.log(i)
```

## const
This defines a constant. It can only be assigned once, and any attempts to change its value will throw an error.
However, an object declared as a `const` can still have its properties changed.
**NOTE:** a block is a region within two braces: `{ }`.
