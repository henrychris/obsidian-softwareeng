# const, var or let?

## var
The `var` keyword declares a function scoped variable, not a block-scoped variable. In the snippet below, it will print 0-9, 'outside' and 10. The value `i` is still defined outside the scope of the `for` loop, and withing the function `stuff`.

```
function stuff() {
    for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        console.log(i)
    }

    console.log("outside");
    console.log(i)
}

stuff();
console.log(i);
```

However, the `console.log(i)` statement after the call to `stuff()` will throw an error as `i` is undefined in that context.
But, if a value is defined with `var` outside of a function, it has global scope.
## let
This defines a block-scoped variable. It will print 0-9 in the `for` loop, and throw an error outside as `i` is undefined.
```
for(let i = 0; i<10; i++) {  
console.log(i)  
}  
console.log(i)
```

**NOTE:** a block is a region within two braces: `{ }`.
## const
This defines a constant. It can only be assigned once, and any attempts to change its value will throw an error.
However, an object or array declared as a `const` can still have its properties changed.

# New Methods / Concepts

## array.concat
This creates a new array, appending the provided value (an array or a single value), to it. 

```js
let a = [1, 2, 3];

let b = a.concat(4);
console.log(b);

// b = [1,2,3,4];
```

If no value is passed, a shallow copy of `a` is created. See: [concat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat). `concat` is preferred to `array.push` in React, because immutable data structures are used. An immutable data structure is one whose state is not modified after it is created.
## array.map
This applies a provided callback function to every member of an array, and returns a new array.

```js
let a = [1,2];

let b = a.map((x) => x + 1);
console.log(b);

// b = [2,3];
```

## Destructuring
This allows unpacking values from arrays, or object properties into  variables. See: [Destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment).
```js
let [d] = [1,2,3];
console.log(d);

// d = 1;

let [b, ...c] = [1,2,3];
console.log(b)
console.log(c)

// b = 1
// c = [2,3]
```

# Objects
```js
// Define an object
const man = {
	name: "Henry",
	age: 21
}

// access the properties
man.name;
man["age"];
```

# Functions
```js
// arrow functions
const square = p => {
	return p * p;
}

const add = (x, y) => {
	return x + y;
};

const subtract = (x, y) => x - y; 

// `function` keyword
const subtract = function(x,y){
	return x - y;
}

subtract(1,2);
```
