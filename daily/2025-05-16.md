Currently watching [Miva Masterclass with Shola Akinlade](https://youtu.be/ekv-ZIWoy0M?t=822). Taking some notes on it:
- The first thing you build doesn't have to be rocket science. You need to get used to building things. So just do it. Then do it again.
- Some people focus on building for too many people. If you build something that makes 5 people very happy, you've done well.
- Product release stages
	- Define requirements
	- Groom (trim fat) requirements
	- Build
	- Test
	- Pilot (beta test)
	- Roll out
