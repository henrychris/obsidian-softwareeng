Software Engineer since 2016. Started at Ghana. Worked in the Netherlands in 2022. Currently pursuing a Masters in Computer Science in England.
# Goals For Mentorship - These should be flexible
- After 3 months
- After 6 months
- After a year

Main goal is to find out what it takes to go from the level I am at to the next. I feel I am good at my role & I have potential, but I don't know what is between me and global roles.
# My Goals
- Global Talent 2027
- *Product Engineer*
# Notes
- Won't tell me what to do
- Will guide me towards my own goals and objectives
- Will help break goals into milestones
- Companies hire people that can solve their problems. Doesn't matter if you're a full back-end engineer or anything. These following attributes make you much more valuable:
	- You must be a good engineer.
	- You must be a problem solver.
	- You must be language agnostic.
- Build confidence with solid fundamentals.
- Nana doesn't believe in gaming the hiring system. If you're good, you're good.
- Theoretical skill can cover for a lack of practical skill
	- e.g when asked why to use RabbitMQ over Kafka, you should be able to answer why one is preferred even without practical experience using both.
- We will randomly pick older topics to review.
- We will build new things using knowledge from previous milestones.
- Send an email, twitter DM or book a meeting whenever
