When purchasing a memecoin, there are a lot of checks I like to perform.
- Is it bundled? And what percentage is currently held?
- Are there social media accounts (not posts). Is the twitter account reused?
- Is it a derivative of a popular coin?
- Who are the top holders? 

But running all these checks takes way too long. It has to be faster. 

I can build a telegram bot to automate this. Each check will be modular, but returned within a single message. If a check fails, the caller should be able to retry that specific check, without the others failing too.

Hopefully, I can work on and then charge for this. No more digging for gold, it's time to sell shovels.
