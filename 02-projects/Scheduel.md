I've been trying to go out w someone but our schedules don't match.

she often says we have to scheduel (schedule + duel) to figure out a good date on her calendar. she's busy af, and some am i. it's a reference to a meme she saw ages ago.

the idea is
- I suggest a date
- she gets a notification with what I suggested, the date & time and how much effort it would take
- she can respond with what she thinks instead and a date that works (could be the same activity or sth else, she can change
- it goes back and forth till we're agreed
- then it adds it to a calendar
- only allow she and I to log in now
