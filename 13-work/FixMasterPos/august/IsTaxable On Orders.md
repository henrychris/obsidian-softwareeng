# Summary
when we create an order from a cart, we're losing the `isTaxable` field during the transfer. this causes a tax calculation bug: if someone manually adjusts a product's price upward on an existing order, and that increase pushes the total above the original `nonTaxableAmount`, we incorrectly calculate tax on the differenceâ€”even for products that should be tax-exempt. 
# Fix
1. add `isTaxable` field to the `productsForSell` schema in the order model,
2. ensure `isTaxable` gets passed from cart to order during order creation,
3. update tax calculation logic to respect the `isTaxable` flag,

this will preserve the original tax exemption status and prevent incorrect tax charges when an order is updated.

# Update
I have completed the migration script. It lives on a branch named `chore/migrate-add-is-taxable-to-orders`.
# Notes
- For variable products, `isTaxable` is stored in the variation object.
```json
{
    "variation": {

- For simple and serialised products, refer to the `isTaxable` field on the object root
