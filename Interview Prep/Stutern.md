# Tell Us About You
I'm Henry Ihenacho Chukwuemeka, and I hold a degree in Management Information Systems from Covenant University. During my studies, I interned at Fuelmetrics in Yaba, where I started building my technical foundation.

Initially, I aimed for a consulting career, accepting an offer from Fritova in Berger. However, I soon realized my interest in fintech and decided to join ErrandPay as a Backend Engineer. There, I gained hands-on experience in fintech processes, particularly the complexity of financial transactions and the numerous partners involved.

In early 2024, I took on a Lead Backend Engineer role at Lights On Heights (Limestone). I led the migration of our platform from a monolithic to a microservices architecture, introduced a custom NATS library to handle communication within the system, and created a Docker environment to streamline development during a length Azure APIM downtime. This role tested my ability to lead large projects and 

Currently, I'm between roles and keeping active with side projects, such as a potential SaaS for writers, various coding challenges & web3. Outside of work, I enjoy reading, writing, and experimenting with game development to refine my programming skills.
# What Are Your Strengths?
- I have strong writing skills.
- I can take the lead on projects and drive them if necessary.
- I can learn what is needed to complete a project quickly.
- I am great at organising my work, and that of others when working in a team.
# What Are Your Weaknesses?
I tend to overthink problems, and go with an overly complex at first when I think the solution can not be that easy. Then, usually, I take a look at it later and choose the simpler option. I always talk over my ideas with team members, or for personal projects, with friends.

Sometimes, i strive too hard for perfect which causes me to take longer to release a project or declare it completed because it isn't **right** yet.
