# Tell Me About Yourself
I'm Henry Ihenacho Chukwuemeka. I studied MIS at Covenant University, while I was there I interned here at Fuelmetrics back when the company was located at Yaba. 

I initially wanted to go into Consulting, and got a job at Fritova located in Berger. But I turned it down and joined ErrandPay as a backend dev. I learned a fair amount about the internals of fintech. The part that surprised me most is the sheer amount of partners involved in a single transaction. 

I'm currently between roles, and I've been keeping busy. I've been working on some side-projects, one is a possible SaaS targeted towards writers, I attended a hackathon and built a fintech product in a week. I've also been solving coding challenges, and writing articles on my Medium page.

I was looking for something new and reached out to a senior colleague from ErrandPay who told me about the opening here. 

As for hobbies, I read a lot, write occasionally and recently i've been working on text-based web games to help learn TypeScript.

# What Are Your Strengths?
- I have strong writing skills.
- I can take the lead on projects and drive them if necessary.
- I can learn what is needed to complete a project quickly.
- I am great at organising my work, and that of others when working in a team.

# What Are Your Weaknesses?
I tend to overthink problems, and go with an overly complex at first when I think the solution can not be that easy. Then, usually, I take a look at it later and choose the simpler option. I always talk over my ideas with team members, or for personal projects, with friends.

Sometimes, i strive too hard for perfect which causes me to take longer to release a project or declare it completed because it isn't **right** yet.

# When you had to learn quickly?
Final Year Project. Had to learn to build with Blazor and SignalR. The former so I could build a fullstack app without having to learn JS or Angular, and the latter for real-time chat.

# Questions To Ask
- What do the first 30, 60, 90 days look like, and how does the onboarding process go?
- What's the dress code here?
- What major issues will I be solving?
- Would I have a manager I could have weekly or bi-weekly 1-1 meetings with?
