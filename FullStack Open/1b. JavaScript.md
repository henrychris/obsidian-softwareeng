# const, var or let?

## var
The `var` keyword declares a function scoped variable, not a block-scoped variable. In the snippet below, it will print 0-9, 'outside' and 10. The value `i` is still defined outside the scope of the `for` loop, and withing the function `stuff`.

```
function stuff() {
    for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        console.log(i)
    }

    console.log("outside");
    console.log(i)
}

stuff();
console.log(i);
```

However, the `console.log(i)` statement after the call to `stuff()` will throw an error as `i` is undefined in that context.
But, if a value is defined with `var` outside of a function, it has global scope.
## let
This defines a block-scoped variable. It will print 0-9 in the `for` loop, and throw an error outside as `i` is undefined.
```
for(let i = 0; i<10; i++) {  
console.log(i)  
}  
console.log(i)
```

**NOTE:** a block is a region within two braces: `{ }`.
## const
This defines a constant. It can only be assigned once, and any attempts to change its value will throw an error.
However, an object or array declared as a `const` can still have its properties changed. They are block-scoped.

# New Methods / Concepts

## array.concat
This creates a new array, appending the provided value (an array or a single value), to it. 

```js
let a = [1, 2, 3];

let b = a.concat(4);
console.log(b);

// b = [1,2,3,4];
```

If no value is passed, a shallow copy of `a` is created. See: [concat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat). `concat` is preferred to `array.push` in React, because immutable data structures are used. An immutable data structure is one whose state is not modified after it is created.
## array.map
This applies a provided callback function to every member of an array, and returns a new array.

```js
let a = [1,2];

let b = a.map((x) => x + 1);
console.log(b);

// b = [2,3];
```

## Math methods

- `Math.floor`: round down to nearest whole number
- `Math.ceil`: round up to next largest integer, regardless of the decimal part. `Math.ceil(4.2) = 5`
- `Math.round`: round to nearest `integer` depending on the decimal. `Math.round(4.2) = 4` while `Math.round(4.5) = 5`
## Destructuring
This allows unpacking values from arrays, or object properties into  variables. See: [Destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment).
```js
let [d] = [1,2,3];
console.log(d);

// d = 1;

let [b, ...c] = [1,2,3];
console.log(b)
console.log(c)

// b = 1
// c = [2,3]
```

# Objects
```js
// Define an object
const man = {
	name: "Henry",
	age: 21
}

// access the properties
man.name;
man["age"];

// add a value
man.gender = "male";

// delete a property from the object
delete man.name
console.log(man.name) // output: undefined

// check that a property exists
man.hasOwnProperty("name");

// loop over all keys in an object
// note that this loop is in a random order, not alphabetically
// or in order of declaration
for (let key in man) {
  console.log(key, man[key]);// output: name Henry \n age 21
}
```

Objects in JS are a collection of key-value pairs, similar to dictionaries in Python. As such, accessing properties using `[]` syntax grants O(1) access.
# Functions
```js
// arrow functions
const square = p => {
	return p * p;
}

const add = (x, y) => {
	return x + y;
};

const subtract = (x, y) => x - y; 

// `function` keyword
const subtract = function(x,y){
	return x - y;
}

subtract(1,2);
```
# Objects and 'this'
`this` refers to the context where a piece of code is running at the time.

When `this` is called in an object, it holds a reference to the object.
When `this` is called in a function, it is usually `undefined` or references the global object.

There can be issues where the code loses track of what 'this' is supposed to be. Try to avoid using it aka avoid as much JS bullshit as possible.
## Global Object
Javascript has a bit of fuckery called the 'global object'. It represents the global scope of the object and can be accessed using `globalThis`. The object varies depending on the runtime environment.

# Classes
It's quite simple. Classes are templates for objects.

```js
class Person
{
	// private property
	#gender;
	
	constructor(name, age, gender){
		this.name = name;
		this.age = age;
		this.gender = gender;
	}
	
	greet(){
		console.log(`Hello. I am ${this.name}.`);
	}
	
	getGender() {
	    return this.#gender;
	}
}

const Jane = new Person("Jane", 20, "Female");
```

A class method can read the private fields of other instances of the same class. Why? Who fucking knows?

# Data Type Notes

## Null & Undefined
JS differentiates between both.
- `undefined` - there is no value present. If you access a non-existent property or variable or a function returns nothing, you get `undefined`.
- `null` - explicitly stating that an entity is a non-value, only occurs when you set a value = null.
## Falsy & Truthy values
1. `false`, `0`, empty strings (`""`), `NaN`, `null`, and `undefined` all become `false` and are 'falsy'.
2. All other values become `true` and are 'truthy'.

# Operator Notes
## Equality Comparisons
There are two operators used to check if values equal one another.
- `==` - performs type coercion and checks if the resulting values equal one another. Type coercion is the automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type to another. The opposite is `!=`.
	- 123 == "123" returns true.
- `===` - straight checks if two operands are equal. no type coercion. no bullshit. The opposite is `!==`.

# Control Structure Notes
## Exception Handling
You can't tell what type of error was thrown, because **anything** can be thrown with a `throw` statement. Why?

```js
function sayName() {
        console.log(
            `Hi, my name is ${this.name}. I am ${this.age} year${
                this.age == 1 ? "" : "s"
            } old. I am ${this.#gender}.`
        );
        
        throw this.name;
    }

```

However, you can safely assume that most errors caught are of type `Error`. Unlike C#, you can't catch a specific type of error, you have to catch them all then check using `instanceof`.

```js
try {
  buildMySite("./website");
} catch (e) {
  if (e instanceof RangeError) {
    console.error("Seems like a parameter is out of range:", e);
    console.log("Retrying...");
    buildMySite("./website");
  } else {
    // if you dont wish to handle other errors, throw em up the stack.
    throw e;
  }
}
```
# Arrays
// read the Array section on the MDN Language Overview.

An array can be created by placing values in square brackets:
```js
const numbers = [1, "two", 3, "four"];
```

Interestingly, an array can be wiped by setting `length` to 0.
```js
const numbers = [1, "two", 3, "four"];
numbers.length = 0;

console.log(numbers.length); // 0
```

`push()` adds a new element (or elements) to an array and returns the new length.
```js
numbers.push(2,3)
```

`pop()` removes the last element and returns the element. It changes the length of the array. If the array empty, it returns undefined.
```js
numbers.pop()
```

`shift()`  removes the first element from an array and returns that removed element. This method changes the length of the array. If the array empty, it returns undefined.
```js
numbers.shift();
```

`unshift()` adds one or more elements to the start of an array and returns the new length.
```js
numbers.unshift(2,3,4)
```

`splice()` may be used to either remove elements from an array:
```js
numbers.splice(start: 0, deleteCount: 1);

// start is a zero-based index.
// deleteCount is th number of elements to delete starting from `start`. 
```
OR
`splice()` can remove elements from an array, and add new elements in their place.
```js
numbers.splice(0, 1, items: 3, 4)
```
The original array is modified and the method returns the deleted elements.
This has a lot of edge cases, and it's best to refer to the docs when needed: [splice](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice)

`slice()` returns a shallow copy (the properties point to the same values in memory) of a an array, starting from a provided index.
```js
numbers.slice(1, 2);
```
We can use negative indexes to start from the end of an array. `slice()` does not include the element at the `end` index. It returns an array with the copied elements.

`filter()` filters an array to get items matching a criteria.
```js
const arr = [1,2,3];
return arr.filter(x => x === 3);

// output: 3
```
# Conditionals & Comparisons
## String Comparison
In JavaScript, when you use comparison operators like `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=` with strings, they are compared lexicographically (dictionary order). This means that strings are compared based on the Unicode values of their characters, one by one, from left to right.
### How It Works:
1. **Character Comparison**: Each character in the string has a corresponding Unicode value. When comparing two strings, JavaScript compares the Unicode values of the characters at each position in the string. The comparison starts from the first character of each string and proceeds character by character until a difference is found.
2. **Order of Characters**: The string whose character has a smaller Unicode value at the first differing position is considered smaller.
3. **If Characters Match**: If characters match at all positions, but one string is shorter than the other, the shorter string is considered smaller.
