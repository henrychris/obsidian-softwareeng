# Core Components
## Node
A **node** is a computer participating in the blockchain network. Nodes **may** maintain a full copy of the entire blockchain ledger or only the recent blocks. The former is known as a **full/archival node**. 
Nodes play various roles such as validating transactions, participating in consensus mechanisms, or mining new blocks. Not all nodes are mining nodes.
### Miners
**Miners** are specialised nodes responsible for verifying and validating blocks before adding them to the chain. They solve complex computational problems (Proof of Work) to ensure the legitimacy of blocks and receive rewards for their efforts.
## Transaction or Data
A **transaction** is the smallest building block of a blockchain, representing records or information. Transactions are broadcast to the network and collectively form the blockchain’s data structure. 

While transactions often involve cryptocurrency, they can represent any type of data depending on the use case.
## Block 
A **block** contains a set of transactions, its own unique hash, and the hash of the previous block. This structure securely links blocks together, forming the blockchain.
- A **hash** is a cryptographic identifier for the block, ensuring integrity. If any data within the block is altered, the hash changes, making tampering easy to detect.
- **Block content** can vary based on the blockchain's use case, storing anything from financial transactions to contract data.

Each block is distributed across the network, where miners validate it through a consensus process. Once validated, the block is added to the chain.
## Chain
A **blockchain** is a sequence of blocks arranged in a chronological order. The inclusion of the **previous block's hash** within each block maintains the integrity of the chain, with the first block being the **genesis block** (which lacks a previous hash).

## Consensus / Consensus Protocol
A **consensus protocol** is a set of rules that governs how blockchain participants agree on the validity of transactions and the addition of new blocks. Common consensus protocols include **Proof of Work (PoW)** and **Proof of Stake (PoS)**.
# General Process
1. A transaction is created and broadcast to the network.
2. Miners collect transactions and create a block.
3. Miners attempt to solve the Proof of Work for that block.
4. Once solved, miners validate the block and broadcast it to the network. 
5. Valid blocks are added to the chain, and miners receive rewards for the computation effort.
# Proof Of Work
Blockchains that use a **Proof of Work** (PoW) require miners to solve a computationally difficult problem to create new blocks. This process slows down the creation of new blocks, ensuring the security and integrity of the blockchain.

In Bitcoin, a _nonce_ (a number that miners can change) is used in the PoW process. Miners repeatedly modify the nonce and hash it together with the block data. The goal is to find a nonce that, when hashed with the block data, produces a hash that begins with a specified number of leading zero bits (the **difficulty target**). This process ensures that mining requires significant computational effort. The difficulty target can be changed to make mining harder.

If any block’s data is tampered with, its hash changes, invalidating subsequent blocks. This requires redoing the PoW for all affected blocks, making tampering computationally impractical.
# Decentralisation
A blockchain network is **decentralised**, meaning that anyone can join by creating a node. Nodes **may** a full copy of the blockchain and verify its integrity independently.

- When a new block is added, it is broadcast to all nodes in the network. Nodes validate the block by checking the proof of work, the hash, and ensuring it adheres to the blockchain's rules (e.g., no double-spending).
- Once validated, nodes add the block to their copy of the chain. The network reaches **consensus** on the valid version of the blockchain, typically through mechanisms like Proof of Work.

To tamper with the blockchain, an attacker would need to modify a block and all subsequent blocks while controlling over 51% of the network's computational power—an impractical task that ensures the blockchain’s integrity.
# Longest Chain Rule
When two versions of a blockchain exist with conflicting transaction histories, the **Longest Chain Rule** resolves the conflict by selecting the chain with the most computational work.
## How it works:
1. **Forks Occur**: Occasionally, two miners may solve the Proof of Work at almost the same time and broadcast their blocks to the network. This creates a temporary fork, where some nodes will receive one block, and others will receive the other.
2. **Nodes Add Blocks**: Some nodes will add one block to their version of the chain, while others will add the conflicting block. Now the blockchain has diverged into two valid versions with different transaction histories.    
3. **Resolve the Conflict**: As more blocks are mined, one of the chains will eventually become longer (have more blocks or more cumulative PoW) than the other. Nodes will then adopt the longest chain as the valid one because more computational work has gone into producing it, which indicates a higher level of security.    
4. **Reorganise and Discard the Shorter Chain**: Once the longest chain is determined, the shorter chain (with less cumulative PoW) is discarded, and the nodes that had previously accepted it switch to the longest chain. Any transactions that were in the discarded chain but not in the longest chain are returned to the unconfirmed pool and may be included in future blocks.
## Why this works:
The longest chain represents the chain with the most accumulated computational work, making it the most secure. This discourages tampering since attackers would need to outpace the entire network's computational power to rewrite the chain - which is **impossibly difficult and expensive**.
serves as both inputs and outputs of transactions.
# Why Does Blockchain Matter?
- **Security**: In a sufficiently decentralised blockchain, there is a very high probability that only valid transactions will be confirmed despite the efforts of malicious actors.
- **Immutability**: Once a block is redundantly confirmed, it becomes a part of the unchangeable ledger that gets increasingly more difficult to alter over time. This makes it an ideal solution for auditing, regulatory compliance, and maintaining accurate records, whether for financial transactions, supply chains, or voting systems.
- **Reliability**: Blockchains have globally distributed networks with 24/7 up-time. They are always online and are not restricted geographically or politically.
- **Efficiency and Cost Reduction**: By removing intermediaries and automating transactions through smart contracts, blockchain reduces operational costs and increases efficiency. For example, cross-border payments, which traditionally require banks or third-party services, can be streamlined using blockchain, reducing delays and transaction fees.
- **Financial Inclusion**: Blockchain allows people without access to traditional banking systems to participate in the global economy. Cryptocurrencies, for example, enable peer-to-peer transactions without the need for a bank account, especially in regions with limited financial infrastructure.
- **Decentralisation**: Traditional systems (like banking, supply chains, etc.) rely on centralised entities for operations and data management. These entities can be single points of failure, prone to errors, manipulation, or corruption. Blockchain eliminates the need for intermediaries by distributing control across a network of nodes, ensuring that no single party can exert undue control.

Overall, blockchains create infrastructure that two or more parties can use to conduct highly secure, reliable, and tamper-proof economic exchange. It provides a foundation for a more transparent, secure, efficient, and decentralised world. 
It has the potential to reshape how we manage digital transactions, data, and assets across virtually every industry.
