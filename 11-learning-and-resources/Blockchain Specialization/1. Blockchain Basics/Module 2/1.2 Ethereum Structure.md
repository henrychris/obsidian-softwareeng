# About
- **Consensus Mechanism**: Ethereum uses **Proof of Stake (PoS)**, where validators secure the network by staking ETH as collateral.
- **Block Time**: Blocks are produced every **12 seconds**, making transactions **faster** compared to networks with longer block times.
- **Smart Contracts**: Ethereum can **deploy and execute smart contracts**, enabling decentralised applications (dApps) and automated agreements on-chain.
- **Block Size**: Ethereum has **smaller block sizes**, which help maintain decentralisation but can limit throughput.
- **ETH Supply Limit**: Although there is no hard cap on total ETH supply, **a maximum of 18 million ETH** can be **minted annually**, controlling inflation.
# Accounts
Ethereum uses accounts, instead of UTXOs like in Bitcoin. Transaction have accounts as targets - funds are sent to and from account addresses.

Ethereum has two account types:
- **Externally-owned account (EOA)** – controlled by anyone with the private keys. It represents a user and holds their ETH balance.
- **Contract account** – a smart contract deployed to the network, controlled by code. It has a piece of code & internal storage. Creating a smart contract requires a fee.

Both accounts store balances and can interact with smart contracts.
Accounts have four fields:
1. Nonce - A counter for number of transactions sent by an EOA or contracts created by a contract account. It is unique and only one transaction with a given nonce may be executed for each account.
2. Balance - The number of wei owned by the address. 1 ETH = 10^18 wei.
3. Code Hash - The code in a smart contract is stored in the EVM. The code is hashed & the hash is used as a unique identifier to fetch it for execution.
4. Storage Root Hash - This is a **256-bit hash of the root node** of the **account's storage Merkle tree**. This hash represents the current state of the account’s storage.
   Account storage state is stored on-chain in the global state tree that tracks all accounts on-chain. Each account has a node on the tree for its internal data (the fields being discussed here).
   Smart contracts store key-value pairs in their account storage node, those values represent their internal variables. Every time the contract’s **internal state** (such as a variable) changes, the **storage trie** is updated. As a result, the **storage root hash** is recalculated to reflect the new state.

# Transactions
Transactions are cryptographically signed instructions from an **externally-owned** account. An account will initiate a transaction to update the state of the Ethereum network. The simplest transaction is transferring ETH from one account to another.
Transactions require a fee and must be included in a valid block. 

After a transaction is created, it is broadcast to the network and added to a *pending* transaction pool. A validator will validate & execute the transaction and propagate the new state across the network. Eventually, the transaction is *finalised*, meaning it is computationally impossible to reverse.

A transaction includes:
- from - sender address
- to - receiver address
- digital signature of the sender (made using the private key)
- nonce - the transaction number from the sender account
- value
- (optional) input data - for contracts
- gas limit - max gas that can be consumed by the transaction
- `maxPriorityFeePerGas` - the maximum price of the consumed gas to be paid to the validator
- `maxFeePerGas` - the maximum fee per unit of gas willing to be paid for the transaction (inclusive of `baseFeePerGas` and `maxPriorityFeePerGas`)
## Types
- **Regular transactions**: a transaction from one account to another.
- **Contract deployment transactions**: a transaction without a 'to' address, where the data field is used for the contract code.
- **Execution of a contract**: a transaction that interacts with a deployed smart contract. In this case, 'to' address is the smart contract address.
# Gas
Gas is a unit that measures the computing effort required to perform an operation on the Ethereum blockchain. It ensures network resources are not misused & prevents spam requests. It is also used as compensation for validators.

Gas is required for any interactions with smart contracts. The only exceptions are `view` and `pure` functions which do not read or modify state - these are free.

Gas has to be paid in ETH, and is usually denominated in gwei. 1 GWEI = (ETH) 10^-9
Note that the fee is paid whether the transaction succeeds or not.

**Gas Cost** is the amount of gas required to perform an operation, e.g. 21, 000 to send a transactions.
**Gas Price** is the price a user is willing to pay per unit of gas. By offering gas, you are bidding to include your transaction in the next block, like an bidding system: the higher the gas price, the more attractive the transaction is to miners/validators.
Also, when the network is congested, the gas prices increase. There are plans to reduce gas fees by scaling Ethereum. With time, fee averages will reduce.

Gas Fee = units of gas used \* (base fee + priority fee).

Base fee is set by the protocol & the priority fee is set by the user. The priority fee is used to compensate validators. The higher it is, the more likely they are to include your transaction.
A **maximum fee** can be specified as well. Although, any unused gas will be refunded to the user.
The base fee is burned, reducing the total ETH supply.

In practice, these calculations aren't manual, but are calculated by wallets. 
# Proof Of Stake
Proof of Stake is a **consensus mechanism** used to **secure the Ethereum network** by requiring validators to stake ETH as collateral. Validators are responsible for **proposing and validating new blocks**. If a validator behaves dishonestly, their **staked ETH** may be **slashed** (destroyed), incentivising good behaviour.
## Validators
A user must stake 32 ETH to participate as a validator. New validators are placed on an activation queue limiting overload of validators on the network.
At the end of the queue, the validator is activated and may receive, verify or create blocks. 
## How It Works
- **Slot**: A 12-second time window where a **random validator** is selected to **propose a new block**.
- **Epoch**: A collection of **32 slots** (6.4 minutes total). Validators work together across an epoch to finalise blocks and reach consensus.
- **Block Proposal**:
    - In **every slot**, a **single validator** is chosen at random to propose a new block.
    - This block is **broadcasted to other validators** in the network for validation.
- **Committees and Attestations**:   
    - For every slot, a **committee of validators** is randomly selected to **validate the proposed block**.
    - If the block is valid, committee members **attest** (approve) the block by signing off on it.
- **Attesting Process**:
    - **Every validator** participates by attesting to the state of the blockchain during **each epoch**, though not every validator attests in every slot.
## Slashing and Penalties
- **Slashing**: Validators that attempt to **cheat, double-sign, or propose conflicting blocks** may have some or all of their staked ETH **slashed**.
- **Offline Penalty**: If a validator fails to stay online and perform its duties (e.g., missing attestations), a small portion of their stake is gradually slashed.
## Fork Choice
In the event of conflicting blockchain histories, Ethereum uses the LMD-GHOST algorithm to select the fork with the most attestations in its history.
It counts attestations on the current block, as well as its predecessors. The fork with the **most accumulated attestations** is considered the valid chain.
## Casper FFG Finalisation
A block is considered **finalised** (irreversible) when **2/3 of validators** on the network have confirmed it through attestations.
- Finalisation takes place after **2 epochs** (approximately **12.8 minutes**).
- Once finalised, a block and its ancestors are guaranteed to be **part of the canonical chain**, ensuring no reorganisation can alter them.
# Blocks
A **block** in Ethereum is a package of data that records transactions, state changes, and other relevant information. Blocks form the **core of the blockchain**, linking together in a sequential chain to maintain the network’s history and security.
## Structure
Each Ethereum block contains:
- **Block Header**:
    - **Parent Hash**: Links the current block to the previous one, ensuring continuity in the chain.
    - **State Root**: A **Merkle Patricia trie** root representing the global state after this block’s transactions.
    - **Transaction Root**: A hash representing all transactions in the block.
    - **Receipts Root**: A hash of the receipts generated from transactions (e.g., gas used, logs).
    - **Difficulty**: Used during the PoW era (legacy) but replaced by **random validator selection** in PoS.
    - **Timestamp**: The time the block was mined or proposed.
- **Transactions**:  
    A list of all **transactions** included in the block, such as ETH transfers, smart contract calls, or token transfers.
- **Block Number**: Identifies the block’s position in the chain.
- **Validator Signature**: In PoS, the validator proposes the block and attaches their **signature** to verify it.
## Block Time and Finality
- **Block Time**:  
    Blocks are produced **every 12 seconds**, making Ethereum's block time shorter than Bitcoin's 10-minute intervals.
- **Finality**:  
    A block becomes **finalised** after **2 epochs** (approximately 12.8 minutes), meaning it cannot be reversed or replaced.
## Gas and Fees
Each transaction in a block consumes **gas**. Gas fees are paid to validators who include transactions in the block. Ethereum uses a **base fee and priority fee** system to optimise gas usage.
## Role of Blocks in Smart Contracts
Smart contract state changes are **committed** within blocks. Once the block is included in the chain, all transactions and state updates become part of the **immutable ledger**.
