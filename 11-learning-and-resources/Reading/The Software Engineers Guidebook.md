# Owning Your Career
## You're in charge. 
1. Set **goals**. 
2. Tell your manager what work you wish to do and care about. 
3. Choose work that creates **impact**. 
4. Share work you do that goes unnoticed. 
5. Create opportunities to receive **feedback**.

## Be Someone Who Gets Things Done
1. Get **impactful** stuff done. Ship high-quality code at a decent pace and over-deliver when necessary. Understand the team's priorities so you know what to do.
2. Make sure people **know** you are getting stuff done!
	- When you finish a task, let people know you are done!
3. Keep a work log. **VERY** important. Check [[01-career/Brag Document Template]] and [[01-career/My Brag Document]]
4. Keep track of plans for the day and log what was done at the end.

## Ask And Give Feedback
- Code reviews
- Share proposals, design documents and ideas and ask for feedback
- Utilise peer performance reviews
- Rather than ask for personal feedback, ask for feedback on work you did, or projects you worked on, or meetings you led. 

Ask for feedback on specific items, like:
```
I made a few pull requests recently. Is there any way I can improve my approach, or a way I am not following existing standards?

OR

This is my first time doing X. Do you have experience handling this? What can I do better next time?
```

## Give Feedback
- Call out good work
- Be specific with your feedback
- Only give positive feedback when you **mean** it
- Give negative or constructive feedback in person
- Make clear that it is only an observation
- Focus on the situation and its impact. "This happened and led to this, because x, y, z."
- Decode poor quality feedback
	- Ask for specific examples
	- Clarify what impact your action had
	- Ask for suggestions
	- If you disagree, explain why you disagree

## Make Your Manager An Ally
- Have regular 1-1 time with them. Discuss challenges, recent work and wins. Ask how you can help them and the team.
- Tell, don't assume they know.
- Understand your manager's goals. This can help you understand what work has an impact.
- Deliver what you agree upon, and give updates when you can't meet up. However, try to be reliable.
- Establish mutual trust.

### Get Your Work Recognised
- Show up prepared with what you've done, challenges you faced and where you needed feedback
- Let them know your goals.
- Share a log.

## Pace Yourself
*Stretching*. *Executing*. *Coasting*.

There are three "paces" a software professional can work at. 
### Stretching
- Learning fast and applying on the go.
- Taking on fresh challenges that require you to step up.
- Don't stretch for too long - it can cause burnout.
- Try to have people who can tell you when you're pushing too hard.

### Executing
- Learn and *do* at a normal rate
- Work with reasonable timelines on familiar work
- No overtime, just get things done and get them done well.
- Say no to extra tasks and let your manager know you are calming down.
### Coasting
- Doing less, lower-quality work for a little while
- Usually for a short while, just a few days, to take a break
- If coasting for too long, find the reason and try to fix it.

Mix up the paces to keep yourself running smoothly.

# Performance Reviews

## Gather Context and Set Goals
### ID the most important factors
- Ask your manager
	- Find out what is important
	- Ask about team goals and company goals and how they are linked. 
	- Ask about your managers personal goals too.
- Ask tenured staff, executives and people with influence.
- Find out how the performance review system
- When do reviews happen?

### Discuss and Agree goals with your manager
- im not sure what kind of goals here, so find out.
- Find out what would be necessary to help you **meet** expectations.

## The Power of Habit
- Record your wins
	- Take screenshots of chats or emails praising your contributions
- Keep a work log
	- Consider making it a living document, where you link to other notable work and constantly update it.
- Share progress with your manager in regular 1:1 meetings. Overshare and don't assume.
- Get things done
	- Finish work that matters and has **impact**
	- Ship good, well-tested and maintainable code
	- Find out what great means in your teams.
- Help others and capture the time you spend helping them
	- Put it in your work log!
- Get regular feedback
	Some situations you could get feedback on:
	- Leading a meeting
	- Presenting to a large group
	- Proposing an initiative
	- Leading a project
	- Resolving an outage

## Gather Feedback From Others
## Create a Self Review
- What you've done
- How you did it
- Compare set goals against achievements
- Check how you fulfil the job requirements in your contract.
- Feedback from peers
- Praise and Positive feedback received


Be open to negative feedback. Embrace it, and improve.

# Thriving In Different Environments

## Product-Minded Engineers and Product Teams
Product teams build products for external customers. Product-minded engineers are those with an interest in the product, who want to know the reasoning behind decisions and love to be involved in product decisions.

They are:
- Proactive about product ideas and opinions
- Quick to offer product/engineering trade-offs
- Involved in features from specification to after roll-out. They care about how it is used in the real world, and the metrics.
- Always learning after each cycle of learning, and eventually have an instinct for what does and does not work in a product.

### How To Become One?
- Understand how and why the company is successful. 
	- What are profit and cost centers?
	- Where does your team fit in?
	- What is the business model?
	- How is money made?
- Build a strong relationship with your product manager and seek regular feedback.
- Engage in user research and pair with teammates that interact with customers.
	- Designers, UI/UX, customer support folks. You will better understand how the products are used.
- Offer product/engineering trade-offs for projects.

## Platform Teams and Engineers
They create the building blocks used by other teams to ship faster. Examples:

- The CI/CD team
- The infrastructure team providing access to compute, storage and hosting.
- The payments team that creates an SDK for others to use for payments.

Platform teams are highly technical and work to create scalable solutions to highly complex problems.

Working in a platform team has its upsides:
- High engineering complexity
- Wide impact
- More freedom with less managers
- Less pressure as they don't interact with customers

and downsides:
- Impact is harder to define and they are often seen as cost centers
- They tend to lose touch with customers

To thrive in a platform team, you must:
- Build empathy with end customers, and **never** forget them
- Talk to engineers using your platforms. Find out their needs and wants
- Rotate between working in platform and product teams.
- Maintain some urgency so you don't go long periods without shipping.


## Wartime vs Peacetime

### Wartime
A company is fending off an immediate existential threat. The threat can be competition, macro-economic or supply chain changes, market change - anything.

#### Thriving in Wartime
- Get things done quickly with good enough quality
- Handle conflicts quickly and do **not** take them personally
- Get the work done regardless of who you have to work with
- Work only on what the business needs
- Work like your job depends on it- it does
- Pace yourself and avoid burnout
- Maintain good standing with your manager

### Peacetime
A company has a large advantage v their main competition. They can focus on expanding market share and reinforcing their strengths.
#### Thriving in Peacetime
- Get things done with **high** quality
- Make allies across teams you work with
- Avoid conflicts and figure out why they occur
- Manage internal politics in all directions
- Pace yourself don't work too slowly and risk stagnating

Companies switch modes cause of necessity. Find a way to be effective in both contexts.

## How To Thrive At Any Company
- Do standout work, based on what your company values
- Help others around you, people never forget
- Don't burn bridges, it's a small industry

# On-boarding At A New Job
Refer to [[The First 90 Days]]

## At Any Company
- Keep a work log from the start
- Keep a weekly journal
	- Three things you learned
	- Three things you didn't understand
- Clarify goals for the first month, next three months, and first 6 months

## At A Smaller Company
- Clarify the work you'll do
- Connect with the most senior person asap
- Don't assume how things work, **ask**.
- Aim to ship in week one. Or max, week two.

## At A Larger Company
- Get an on-boarding buddy who you can ask questions. This person must be okay with being interrupted
- Keep a cheat-sheet document where you record everything new. This could be acronyms, build scripts, guides to use internal tools or links to key resources. Afterwards, you can update the on-boarding documentation.
- Familiarise yourself with the tech stack.

# Getting Things Done

1. Focus on the most important piece of work
2. Unblock yourself
3. Break down the work
4. Estimate the duration of work
5. Seek out mentors
6. Keep your goodwill balance topped up
7. Take the initiative
## Focus on the most important piece of work
- Ask yourself, if i could only get one thing done this week - **what would it be?**
- Make sure to complete that **task** in the agreed timeframe. Make it a habit to always complete **that #1** task. Even if you need to skip meetings.
- Learn to say no.
	- "I'd love to help, **BUT**, XYZ is my #1 task right now. When I finish, I'll reach out."

## Unblock Yourself
- In the first week, find out who you need to ask to get answers to certain questions.
- Know when you are blocked
	- If you spend more than an hour without progress - you are blocked. Find help.
- Try different approaches to unblocking
	- Rubber-duck debugging
	- Put your approach on paper
	- Read documentation
	- Search online for similar problems
	- Ask a question on internal or external Q&A sites
	- Take a break
	- Use **AI**.
- **NOTE:** Before admitting being blocked, think about what else you can do to solve a situation. Like, when blocked by a person, see if someone else can do it - or if you can do it yourself.
- Ask for help from teammates.

### Learn to Escalate - Without Ruffling Feathers
Escalation often means using a manager to pass across a message using their authority. It can harm personal relationships, so move carefully.

A guide:
- **Explain**: why you need help, and give context. Context includes the problem/requirement, when it is due, and any other thing that conveys the seriousness.
- **Ask**: If you get no response, ask why.
- **Warn**: Mention you would escalate, or are considering it if you get no response.
- **Escalate**

Always thank people when they help you, note it in your work log, work chat rooms where it is appropriate, and to their manager.

Page 109 - "**I'm blocked - A cheat-sheet.**"

## Break Down The Work

- Think in terms of stories, tasks, and sub tasks.
	 Imagine a user story where admin users should be able to manage auctions. You can break this into different tasks:
	 - Create Auction
	 - Update Auction
	 - Delete Auction
	 - Get Auctions
	Each task can have subtasks. For Create Auction:
	- Validate incoming request
	- Save auction to database
	- prevent duplicate auctions
	- write tests
	- update postman documentation
	
	You can also choose to create a barebones implementation for the golden path, then create separate tasks for edge cases.

- Prioritise work that gets you closer to shipping. Try and have a minimum testable version asap, so you can clarify that you are on the right path.
- Don't be afraid to change, remove and add tasks. The aim is to build software. If new requirements pop up, add them.
