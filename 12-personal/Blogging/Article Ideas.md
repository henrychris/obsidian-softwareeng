## Ideas
- setting up a basic web server to get a simple site exposed on the Internet 
	- [Server Side Intro](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/First_steps/Introduction)
- implementing user auth from scratch in a simple web app
- implementing CI/CD inside your project to auto-deploy updates to the simple web app from earlier 
- then a simple email server. I'm certain there are other reasons for using providers like SendGrid. Things like reputation and keeping your emails out of the spam folder of recipients.
