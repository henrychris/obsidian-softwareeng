## Understanding the Basics
### Important Timing Note
Even though you get paid on the 4th of each month, that payment is for the **previous month's** work. This means:
- Payment received on February 4th = January salary
- January tax is due by February 21st
- Payment received on March 4th = February salary
- February tax is due by March 21st

**Tax Deadline: 21st of each month**

## Part 1: PAYE Tax (Regular Salary)
PAYE (Pay As You Earn) is the tax on your regular employment income. The good news is that **this amount stays the same every month**, making it easy to plan for.
### How to Calculate Your Monthly PAYE
**1. Calculate your annual salary:** Take your monthly salary and multiply by 12
```
Example: Monthly salary = ₦572,700
Annual salary = ₦572,700 × 12 = ₦6,872,400
```

**2. Calculate annual tax using tax brackets:**
- First ₦800,000 = Tax-free
- Next ₦2,200,000 (₦800K to ₦3M) = 15%
- Next ₦3,872,400 (₦3M to ₦6.87M) = 18%
```
Tax calculation:
  ₦2,200,000 × 15% = ₦330,000
  ₦3,872,400 × 18% = ₦697,032
  Total annual tax = ₦1,027,032
```
**3. Divide by 12 to get monthly payment:**
```
₦1,027,032 ÷ 12 = ₦85,586 per month
```
### How to File PAYE on etax.lirs.net
1. Go to etax.lirs.net and log in
2. On the sidebar, Select 'Payments' > 'Generate Bill'. Choose 'Oshodi/Isolo Tax Office' as agency, and 'PAYE (Pay As You Earn)' as revenue.

3. Download and open the sample template and enter the required information. Note for the following fields:
    - **Gross Amount:** Your monthly salary (e.g., ₦572,700)
    - **Tax Amount:** Your monthly tax (e.g., ₦85,586)
4. Generate the bill and pay before the 21st of the month
5. Save a copy of your payment receipt
### What if You Get a Second Job?
If you take on additional employment, you need to update your tax calculation:
1. Add both monthly salaries together and multiply by 12
2. Recalculate your annual tax using the combined amount
3. Divide by 12 for your new monthly payment
```
Example:
  Job 1: ₦572,700/month
  Job 2: ₦300,000/month
  Combined annual: (₦572,700 + ₦300,000) × 12 = ₦10,472,400
  New annual tax = ₦1,654,632
  New monthly payment = ₦137,886
```

## Part 2: WHT on Side Gigs (Consultancy/Commission)
If you do freelance work or consultancy on the side, you pay Withholding Tax (WHT) at 5% of your earnings. This is **separate from your PAYE** and is filed differently.
### How to Calculate WHT
Simply multiply your freelance income by 5%.
```
Example:
  Freelance gig payment: ₦1,454,334
  WHT = ₦1,454,334 × 5% = ₦72,717
```
### How to File WHT on etax.lirs.net
1. Go to etax.lirs.net and log in
2. On the sidebar, Select 'Payment' > 'Generate Bill'. Choose 'Oshodi/Isolo Tax Office' as agency, and 'WHT for Consultancy' as revenue.
3. Download and open the sample template and enter the required information. Note for the following fields: 
	-  **Gross Amount:** Enter the total income
	- **Tax Amount:** Enter 5% of the gross amount
4. Generate and pay by the 21st of the following month
**Important:** WHT for consultancy is paid the month **after** you earn the money. So if you complete a gig in February, you pay the WHT by March 21st.
### Key Terms
- **Commission = Consultancy income** (these are the same category for tax purposes)
- Both are taxed at 5% WHT

## Part 3: Interest Income
**Good news: You don't need to pay tax on interest income!** The bank or investment platform (like Piggyvest) already deducts 10% Withholding Tax before paying you.
### What You Need to Do
- **Keep records:** Save statements showing your interest income
- **For annual returns only:** You can list the net amount (after WHT) when filing your annual tax returns, but it's optional since tax was already deducted at source
```
Example from Piggyvest statement:
  Gross Interest: ₦6,923.04
  WHT Deducted (10%): ₦692.30
  Net Received: ₦6,230.74

  You only received ₦6,230.74 because ₦692.30 was already sent to the tax office.
```

## Part 4: Filing Annual Tax Returns
Once a year, you need to file a tax return that summarizes all your income from the previous year.
### Key Information
- **Deadline:** End of March each year for the previous year
    - Example: File 2026 returns by March 31, 2027
- **Where:** etax.lirs.net under 'My Tax Returns'
### What to Include in Your Returns
- **Employment income:** Your annual salary
- **Commission/Consultancy:** Total freelance income for the year
- **Interest:** List the net amount you received (optional, since WHT was already deducted)
- **Mutual funds:** These count as bonds and are tax-free

### About Rent Relief
**I suggest you skip the rent relief claim.** While you can claim tax relief for rent paid, some landlords may increase your rent if they find out you're using their receipts for tax purposes. Plus, it requires you to ask for their payer id and tax id. The relief amount is capped at 20% with a maximum of 500,000 NGN, and may not be worth it if the landlord raises the rent by more than that amount.
