# Test isolation is expensive
If you try to break apart functions or features into units, so that you can see where something went wrong, it means:
1. You write more tests.
2. Your code might become more complicated as you introduce interfaces (for mocking), or go through hoops to make the code testable.
3. Code and tests become less maintainable.

This can be better understood when comparing integration tests to unit tests.

```
	[Fact]
    public async void TestFahrenheitCalculation()
    {
        Assert.Equal(94,new WeatherForecast(new DateOnly(2025, 1, 2), 35, "Warm")
            .TemperatureF);
    }

    [Fact]
    public async Task EndpointTestOK()
    {
        await WithTestServer(async (c) =>
        {
            c.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("Authorization", "Bearer 12345");
            var response = await c.GetAsync("/weatherforecast");
            Assert.Equal(HttpStatusCode.OK, response.StatusCode);
            var json = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
            var forecast = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<WeatherForecast>(json,
                new JsonSerializerOptions { PropertyNameCaseInsensitive = true });
            Assert.Equal(forecast.Date, new DateOnly(2025, 1, 2));
            Assert.Equal(forecast.TemperatureC, 35);
            Assert.Equal(forecast.TemperatureF, 94);
            Assert.Equal(forecast.Summary, "Warm");
        });
    }

    [Fact]
    public async Task EndpointTestUnauthorized()
    {
        await WithTestServer(async (c) =>
        {
            c.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("Authorization", "Bearer 54321");
            var response = await c.GetAsync("/weatherforecast");
            Assert.Equal(HttpStatusCode.Unauthorized, response.StatusCode);
        });
    }
```

The 1st test, `TestFahrenheitCalculation`, only verifies the functionality of the function. If you were to test authorisation or routing, you'd need to create new tests for middleware and system tests.
The other two are *integration tests.* In one swing, they test the server startup, authentication/authorization AND the function. This means more test coverage, with **less** code written.

Always compare the trade-offs when deciding to or not to isolate tests. For example, strictly logical blocks of code should use unit tests.
