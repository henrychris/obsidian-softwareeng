- Read Prompt
- If lost or unsure about what to do, watch **approach** video
- write the code to solve the problem
- if stuck, watch **walkthrough** video
- redo the problem until you don't need to use **approach** and **walkthrough** videos. This iterative process helps in understanding the [[05-data-structures-and-algorithms/Data Structures/Big O Notation]] of different solutions.

After you have *mastered* a topic, move on to the next.
